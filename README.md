#  FoodSense AI — Recipe Improvement Advisor

FoodSense AI is an intelligent multi-agent system that analyzes unstructured food reviews and generates actionable recipe improvement insights using AI, Machine Learning, NLP, and LLM-based reasoning.

This project demonstrates how modern AI agents can collaborate to transform raw customer feedback into meaningful recommendations for chefs, restaurants, and food product teams.

---

##  Project Overview

FoodSense AI processes customer review data and performs:

* Review Summarization
* Sentiment Analysis
* Issue Identification
* Recommendation Generation

The system uses a **multi-agent workflow** built with LangGraph, where specialized agents handle different analytical tasks and collaborate to produce a final improvement report.

##  Key Features

✅ Multi-Agent Architecture
✅ NLP-based Review Understanding
✅ LLM Prompt Engineering
✅ Automated Insight Generation
✅ Modular and Scalable Workflow Design

---

##  Architecture

The workflow is divided into multiple agents:

* **Review Analyzer Agent** — Understands customer feedback
* **Sentiment Agent** — Detects positive/negative sentiment
* **Advisor Agent** — Suggests improvements
* **Reporter Agent** — Generates final structured output

Each agent performs a specific task and passes results through a graph-based pipeline.

##  Dataset Note

Large dataset files are **not uploaded** due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit.

Due to GitHub file size limits, datasets are not included in this repository.

Download datasets from the links provided in: data/dataset_links.txt After downloading, place the files inside the data folder before running the project.

##  Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/kshitijbhosale820/foodsense.git
cd foodsense
```

Create virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install Ollama (for local LLM):

```
Download from: https://ollama.com
Then pull a model:
ollama run mistral
(You can also use a smaller model like phi)
Press Ctrl + C after the model loads.
```
